# Cursor Rules for Website Project

## Documentation Guidelines

**DO NOT create markdown files for each prompt or task.** 

- Only create README files and other markdown files that are necessary for understanding the codebase at a high level
- Do NOT create:
  - Review documents
  - Summary documents
  - Overhaul documentation
  - Audit reports
  - Performance reports
  - Checklists or task lists as markdown files
  - Any documentation that tracks work done rather than explaining the codebase

- Only create markdown files when they are:
  - Essential README files (e.g., `README.md` for project overview, component-specific READMEs for complex features)
  - Documentation that helps developers understand how to use or maintain the codebase
  - Configuration or setup instructions that are part of the project structure

Keep the repository clean and focused on code, not documentation clutter.
