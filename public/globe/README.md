# Globe Textures

This directory should contain the local earth texture file.

## Required File

- `earth-blue-marble.jpg` - A local copy of the earth texture (recommended size: 1024x512 or 2048x1024)

## Getting the Texture

You can download a free earth texture from:
- NASA Blue Marble images (public domain)
- Or use the remote URLs as fallback (already configured in GlobeClient.tsx)

The component will automatically fall back to remote URLs if the local file is not found.
