# Content Checklist

## Visuals & Captions
- Hero/scene imagery (grain + cinematic black) — provide final art for each hover panel.
- Portrait or candid for “Vinay” introduction.
- Photos for activity sections (sports, hiking, scuba, gym) with short captions.
- Travel galleries per country (3+ shots/country) with location + context notes.
- Playlist cover art or thumbnails for Spotify embeds.

## Copy & Story
- Short bios for hover panels (Tampa, nerd origin, etc.).
- “What I’m chasing next” narrative paragraph and prioritized focus areas.
- Projects: updated tagline, tags, CTA copy per card.
- Timeline bullets for each milestone (Tampa → present) with 1–3 lines (feel free to add gallery cues).
- Activity stories (sports rituals, hiking milestones, etc.).
- Music notes (instrument anecdotes, playlist blurb, theater favorites).

## Travel & Music Data
- Final list of countries with years traveled + highlight lines (for map + modals).
- Playlist names, descriptive lines, and exact Spotify URLs (or embed snippets).
- Preferred musical theater list + why each song/show matters.

## Metrics & Rituals
- Gym lifts & progress tracking format (weights, reps, cadence).
- “Board of Directors” names + context (why they’re here, contact notes).
- Any existing playlists, lifts logs, or boards that should stay in sync with the updates.

## Links & Integrations
- Confirm destination URLs for projects (Recall, Anchor, etc.).
- Provide LinkedIn, GitHub, and private board sharing notes.
- Music embeds (Spotify) or placeholders to swap in once available.
